Build instructions:

On Windows:
 Using Atmel Studio 6.0:
  Download Atmel Studio 6.0 and install it.
  Open the solution one_net_2.3.1

 On windows XP
  In the solution explorer on the right of the screen, highlight the "one_net_2.3.1 project"
  Click the Right button of the mouse 
  From the drop down list select properties
  Click on the Toolchain tab on the left of the screen
  Under the AVR/GNU C Compiler
  Highlight the Directories item
  Under the Include Paths (I) scroll down to the end
  Doble cllick on the last item
  In the Edit Include paths (-I) pop up window
  Change the beginning of the text "c:\program files (x86)\" to "c:\program files\"
  Press the OK button
  Click on the File item in the main menu
  In the drop down list, click on Save All
  Click on the Build item in the main menu, 
  In the drop down list, click on Rebuild Solution

  On windows 7
   Click on the Build item in the main menu, 
   In the drop down list, click on Rebuild Solution



Using the command line:
 Download avr toolchain from Atmel's website and install it.
 In the folder c:\Program Files\atmel\AVR Tools under bin double click on win-bash
 In the bash shell, go to the folder:  ONE_NET_2_3_1/processors/atmel/avr_studio/OBEE_Eval/one_net_2.3.1
 
 for build type
   make
  for clean type
   make clean
  for programming the atxmega256a3b flash type
   make program 
 
 NOTE:
  If you installed Atmel Studio 6.0 and the CLI toolchain from Atmel or WinAVR and you are using a programming 
  device plugged into the USB port:
   You need to install libusb-win32 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb-win32/
   Use the graphical installer and select the device you wish to use for libusb-win32. 
   In our case we used the JTAGICE Mk2. 
   Unplug and plug in the device after the install of libusb-win32 and you should be able
   to program the device from both Atmel Studio 6 and the command line using "make program".

On Linux:
 Make sure you have the AVR GCC compiler installed from Atmel's website. 
 This version of the compiler supports the XMEGA chip used on the OBee.

 Open a terminal and go to the folder: 
 ONE_NET_2_3_1/processors/atmel/avr_studio/OBEE_Eval/one_net_2.3.1 
 for build type
  make
 for clean type
  make clean
 for programming the atxmega256a3b flash type
  make program
