ONE-NET Quad Output Relay Board Change Log.

Version 	Date            Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.3         2008.01.02      Added functionality to erase the flash on start up
                            if the flash check pins are tied together.

                            Updated to use v0.10 of ONE-NET.
                            
0.2         2007.11.21      Moved some constants to the appropriate hardware
                            file.  Initialized tick time constants with a
                            MS_TO_TICK macro.

            2007.11.19      Renamed quad_output.c to simple_output.c.
                            Refactored to handle any number of outputs.

                            Added _QUAD_OUTPUT and _DUAL_OUTPUT macros to areas
                            in client_port_const.h, and pal.c so that the rest
                            of the hardware specific files can be shared by the
                            quad and dual output boards since from a software
                            standpoint, they are almost the same.

                            Added the simple_input project.

                            Using v0.9 of ONE-NET.

0.1         2007.11.16      Initial release using v0.8 of ONE-NET.
