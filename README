This is the official release of ONE-NET Version 2.0.2.  This release does not include Block, Stream, or Simple Client.  Official documentation will not be available until ONE-NET 2.0 Final (i.e. non-Beta) is published.  


In the meantime, more documentation and notes will be added regularly.  Also, please see the documentation at...

https://one-net.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/one-net/tags/ONE_NET_2_0_0_alpha_with_block/docs  (some is out of date, but better than nothing).
