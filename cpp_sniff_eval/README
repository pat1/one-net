This is the official release of ONE-NET Version 2.0.3.  This release does not include Block or Stream.  It does include 16K Simple Client, unlike ONE-NET Beta 2.0.2 16K.  Official documentation will not be available until ONE-NET 2.0 Final (i.e. non-Beta) is published.  Please see the "docs" folder for documentation.  Please also see the ONE-NET_2_0_3_Beta_Release_Notes_Jan202011.doc document for ONE-NET Beta 2.0.3 Release notes within the "docs" folder.


In the meantime, more documentation and notes will be added regularly.  Also, please see the documentation at...

https://one-net.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/one-net/tags/ONE_NET_2_0_0_alpha_with_block/docs  (some is out of date, but better than nothing).
