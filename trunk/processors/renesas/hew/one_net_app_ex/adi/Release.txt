Release Notes for ONE-NET Simple Device Application Example.

Version     Date                Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.6         31 July 2007        Updated to use ONE-NET preliminary release 0.7.

0.5         27 July 2007        Updated to use ONE-NET preliminary release 0.6.

0.4         5 February 2007     Initial release consisting of a simple switch
                                and a simple output device (light/outlet)
                                example.  Project workspace contains a project
                                for each example that runs on an R8C/1B with
                                16K ROM & 1K RAM.  These examples include the
                                ONE-NET prelimary release v0.4

                                The simple switch example does sleep when it
                                can.  The output example is a device that needs
                                to be line powered as it has to continually stay
                                awake and listen for a message.

                                Both projects read the battery status from the
                                ADI transceiver.  This means that the
                                BATTERY_THRESHOLD variable will need to be
                                updated with the appropriate value for the
                                hardware used.  The ADCIN pin on the ADI
                                transceiver can alternatively be used
                                (depending on the hardware) by replace the
                                function calls to READ_BATTERY_STATUS to
                                READ_PWR_STATUS and replacing the variable
                                LOW_BATTERY_THRESHOLD with LOW_PWR_THRESHOLD.
                                The LOW_PWR_THRESHOLD will need to be updated
                                accordingly.
