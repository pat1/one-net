This README contains a brief explanation of the hardware specific type
definitions that ONE-NET expects.  The code below between
"+++++START one_net_types.h+++++" and "+++++END one_net_types.h+++++" contains
the one_net_types.h file that ONE-NET expects.  This code should be copied to
one_net_types.h and modified according to the platform.  The definitions that
need to be modified are:

UInt8 - this is an unsigned 8 bit value.
SInt8 - signed 8 bit value
UInt16 - unsigned 16 bit value
SInt16 - signed 16 bit value
UInt32 - unsigned 32 bit value
SInt32 - signed 32 bit value
Float32 - 32-bit float value.

The remaining definitions should not be changed.
