Version 	Date            Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.5         2007.12.31      Added assigning/unassigning peers to the MASTER,
                            and the ability for the MASTER to use the user pins.

                            Added erasing the flash if the uart tx & rx pins are
                            connected to each other during startup.

            2007.12.26      Updated to use 0.10 version of ONE-NET.

0.4         2007.12.10      Added Semtech version

                            Renamed processors/renesas/src/eval_adi to
                            processors/renesas/src/eval, so as much as possible
                            can be reused with the other R8C23 eval boards using
                            different transceivers.  Created an adi folder
                            inside to contain the adi specific files.  Also,
                            changed the ncrt0.a30 & sect30.inc files to files
                            that are produced with Renesas Project Generator
                            (Ver.4.8).  Added the nc_define.inc file.

0.3         2007.11.26      Changed "sniff" command to include the region (it
                            has the same parameters as the channel command).

            2007.11.21      Moved some constants to the appropriate hardware
                            file.  Initialized tick time constants with a
                            MS_TO_TICK macro.
                            
            2007.11.20      Using v0.9 of ONE-NET.

                            Changed oncli channel command to take "US" or "EUR"
                            as a parameter to indicate whether to use the US or
                            European frequencies.

0.2         2007.11.16      Initial release using v0.8 of ONE-NET.
