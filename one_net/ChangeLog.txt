Version 	Date            Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.10        2008.01.02      Added ability for MASTER to assign itself as a peer.

                            Fixed a few bugs with the _ONE_NET_SIMPLE_DEV
                            preprocessor directive and moved some functions into
                            a #ifdef _ONE_NET_MULTI_HOP in one_net_client.c

            2007.12.26      Added layer on CLIENT side between the application
                            and MAC to handle peers.  This layer handles
                            peer assignment/removal, and sending messages to
                            the peer list.

0.9         2007.12.05      Move on_encode and on_decode to their own file in
                            the utility folder.

            2007.11.28      Prepended "ona_" on files in one_net/app, and
                            "one_net_" on files in one_net/utility that still
                            needed something in the name to distinguish they
                            were ONE-NET files.

            2007.11.27      Removed power mode from ONE-NET and updated ONE-NET
                            version to 0x04.

                            Changed the way the MASTER checked whether or not it
                            needed to send the new key fragment and the new
                            stream key udpates.

                            Bug Fix: CLIENT retrying a single admin transaction
                            (ie transaction failed, so it'd try a multi-hop
                            packet).

            2007.11.26      Bug Fix: MASTER reporting the correct data to
                            master_single_txn_status.

                            Bug fix: If the CLIENT was joining a network, and
                            it's first status response message to complete the
                            join was not acknowledged, it would never send the
                            complete packet again.

                            Fixed bug where the first packet sent to the peer
                            list for the given unit may not have the correct
                            destination unit.

            2007.11.21      Moved some constants to the appropriate port_const
                            file.

            2007.11.19      Added enumerations for setting/getting the channel.

0.8         2007.11.14      Removed swapping of sender and receiver if the first
                            multi-hop data rate test failed.

                            Fixed race condition in CLIENT where it would report
                            that the single transaction is complete, and use the
                            single transaction space to sent the single
                            transaction ack, but the app would overwrite the
                            data with the next packet to be sent.

                            Added functions to convert between ms and ticks.

                            When a multi-hop repeat packet is received, instead
                            of setting the response to take
                            max hops - hops taken back, use max_hops.

            2007.11.13      Added one_net_timer.

            2007.11.07      Created FILE_NAME_port_const.h.README.txt files.

            2007.11.05      Added device_is_awake callback to MASTER.

                            Fixed CLIENT to use correct fragment delays.

                            Added retry count to MASTER & CLIENT transaction
                            status functions.

            2007.10.31      Added seperate stream key, and extended admin
                            functions.

            2007.09.18      Added CLIENT functionality to remove all instances
                            of a peer device at once.

            2007.09.13      Refactored implementation of client_list.

            2007.08.28      Added reporting in both the MASTER and CLIENT when
                            a device successfully joins a network.

                            Set MAX_NONCE to be the actual max nonce, not
                            max nonce + 1.

            XXXX.XX.XX      Added cli to ONE-NET.

                            CLIENT's having multiple peers and sending by unit,
                            multi hop, and power simple (app layer)
                            functionality.

                            Added priority to fragment delay admin packets.
